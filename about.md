  Hey there! Welcome to R's circus.
</p>

Some fun facts about the setup of this github pages page include:

-   This page might be superseded with something less fancy, however,
-   It is based on [Hydeout](https://fongandrew.github.io/hydeout/)
-   Which is based on [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde)
-   Which is based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com/)
-   Which was initially created by [Mark](https://twitter.com/mdo)
-   Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
-   Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
-   And extended by me, because it didn't have enough [a11y](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a11y) for my taste
-   And I use both [vim](https://www.vim.org/) and [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). ðŸ˜±

You can find my usual writing [here on rscircus.org](http://rscircus.org). Recently I started to work more in GitHub contributing to various FLOSS projects. The blog will be merged one day.

Thanks for reading!
