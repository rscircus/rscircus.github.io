  Hey there! Welcome to R's circus.
</p>

Some fun facts about the setup of this github pages page include:

-   This page might be superseded by a hugo version soon, however,
-   It's based uses [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde)
-   Which is based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com/)
-   Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
-   Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
-   Which was initially created by [Mark](https://twitter.com/mdo)
-   And extended by me, because it didn't have enough [a11y](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a11y) for my taste.

Thanks for reading!
