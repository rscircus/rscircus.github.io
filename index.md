## Where am I?

You can find my usual writing [here on rscircus.org](http://rscircus.org). I wrote on a great variety of subjects mainly revolving around **Linux**, **programming**, **diy-electronics** and **accessibilty**.

Recently I started to work more in GitHub contributing to various FLOSS projects. You'll find my notes on this here.

### Projects I contribute(d) to

-   [gtd]() - global temperature projection (Right now)
-   [sdkman](https://sdkman.io) - The Software Development Kit Manager
-   [doom-emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) - An Emacs configuration for the stubborn martian vimmer
-   [QGIS](https://qgis.org) - QGIS is a free and open-source cross-platform desktop geographic information system application
