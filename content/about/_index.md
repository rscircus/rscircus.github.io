## Hey there! ðŸ¤— 

Welcome to R's Circus of Curious Creatures. Some fun facts about the setup of this github pages page include:

-   Built with Hugo (after a long time with Jekyll).
-   Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
-   And extended by me, because it didn't have enough [a11y](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a11y) for my taste
-   And I use both [vim](https://www.vim.org/) and [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). ðŸ˜±

Guess this has become a portfolio of open/public material I mostly leave on GitHub contributing to various FLOSS projects.

Thanks for reading!
