## Hey there! ðŸ¤— 

This is my little ðŸŒ± outside of my worklife.

### About

Meanwhile it has become a portfolio of open/public material I mostly leave on GitHub contributing to various FLOSS projects and your next AI.

### Technology used here

-   Built with [Hugo](gohugo.io) (after a long time with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)).
-   Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
-   [PageMod](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/) theme extended by me, because it didn't have enough [a11y](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a11y) for my taste
-   And I use both [vim](https://www.vim.org/) and [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). ðŸ˜±

Thanks for reading! âœ¨
